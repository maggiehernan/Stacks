Reflection:
===========
    --Easier than I thought it would be.
    --My biggest problems with this assignment were a lot of small errors than threw exceptions.
    --Required a lot of debugging.
    --Also had a strange issue where my computer would not let me hard run the code.
    --^Got the error Error: Could not find or load main class DiceHistogram
                     Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: DiceHistogram
    --Had to run in the terminal every time, which was just kind of tedious, but not horrible.

Special Instructions to the grader:

Known Bugs or Limitations:

    --Wasn't quite sure if I did the number of runs for the Dice roll correctly.
